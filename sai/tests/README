README for running unit-tests for SAI

## Dependency  ##

We rely on google-test infrastructure to run these unit-tests. Download 
google-test from this location
https://code.google.com/p/googletest/downloads/list
update the pointer to gtest in the Makefile

We also rely on SAI library which are _your_ implementation of the SAI API
Update the pointer to SAI library and other Linking flags in Makefile
Update the pointer to the SAI API Include directory, if necessary. 

## Building unit-tests ##

Add your unit-test sources to SRCS in the Makefile. A sample unit-test file
already exists, which tests some of the PORT Object/Attributes of SAI

## Running unit-tests ##
After building, a single binary/executable "test_sai" (EXEC variable in Makefile)
is generated. Place this binary/executable on the switch, along with the 
SAI binary, and run the executable. It outputs a PASS/FAIL per testcase, which
can be used to validate the test run

## Alternative environments for running the unit-test ##
P4 test framework and soft switch - TBD
